# My Experimental Portfolio.
My constantly evolving personal portfolio website. After building my first portfolio in React I decided to build a new and simplified portfolio using Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  This site is simple, incredibly fast, responsive, and becoming more and more accessible with every iteration.  Here you can visit my projects, learn about me, and read my blog posts.
